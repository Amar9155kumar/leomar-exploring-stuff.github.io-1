  "what is the best time to wake up in the morning?": "The best time to wake up really depends on your routine, but most experts recommend between 5 AM and 7 AM. At this time the air is fresh, your mind is calm, and you naturally feel more energetic for the whole day. If you’re a student, this is also the best time to study because your brain is sharp and your memory power is high. Try adjusting your sleep schedule gradually so your body gets used to waking up early without feeling tired.",

  "how many hours of sleep should I get at night?": "On average, a healthy adult needs 7 to 8 hours of sleep per night. Sleep refreshes your mind, reduces fatigue, and helps you focus better the next day. If you’re preparing for exams, never compromise by sleeping less than 6 hours, otherwise your concentration and energy will drop. If you go to bed around 11 PM, try to wake up around 6 or 7 AM for the best balance of rest and productivity.",

  "what should I do if I feel sleepy while studying?": "Feeling sleepy while studying is common, but there are simple tricks to overcome it. First, make sure your study place is well-lit and not too comfortable, like avoiding the bed. Take a short break every 40–50 minutes to drink water, stretch, or walk a little. If you tend to study late at night, ensure you’ve already had proper rest so your body isn’t too tired. Another trick is to switch subjects—if theory makes you sleepy, try solving problems or writing notes instead to keep your brain active.",

  "what is a simple way to lose weight?": "Losing weight doesn’t happen through magic, but through small and consistent habits. Do at least 20–30 minutes of walking or light exercise every day. Avoid eating too much oily or sugary food, and always include vegetables or salad on your plate. Try reducing fast food slowly rather than cutting it out all at once. Drink plenty of water throughout the day. Most importantly, be patient—healthy weight loss takes time. If you stay consistent, you will notice visible changes within 2–3 months.",
